# MathPlay


## Inspiration
This was inspired by our strength in mathematics. We want other students to succeed just like us, which was why I created this project.

## What it does
This project gamifies mathematics by turning the textbook problems into fun puzzles. This should stimulate every student's mind.

## How we built it
We used HTML, Javascript, and CSS to build this website. We also used Vue.js in order provide an efficient framework.

## Challenges we ran into
The main problem of developing was to create a mathematical manipulator system that saves not only numbers, but mathematical expressions. A̶n̶d̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶r̶s̶e̶,̶ ̶w̶e̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶g̶r̶a̶m̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶s̶p̶a̶g̶h̶e̶t̶t̶i̶ ̶c̶o̶d̶e̶.̶

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the two Algebra concepts we added into the site. It proves that this project can be extended to fulfill the needs of millions of students. And also, we're high school freshman doing our first hackathon.

## What we learned
We learned that we should use a framework in order to make the project run smoothly. And also, train your developers to not use spaghetti code!

## What's next for MathPlay
We might expand this towards more concepts, and maybe proofs, logic, and derivatives can be added towards the app. We might turn this into a math central for our EHT High School!
